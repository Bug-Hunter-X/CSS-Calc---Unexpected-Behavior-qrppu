# CSS Calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function, specifically involving percentages and nested calculations.  The bug occurs when the `calc()` function is used in a context where the parent element's width is not clearly defined or involves further calculations, leading to unpredictable results.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version.
