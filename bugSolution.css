To resolve the issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width (using pixels, ems, or percentages).  Avoid overly complex nested calculations within `calc()`.  Consider using alternative layout techniques, such as flexbox or grid, if the layout becomes too intricate.  It is also beneficial to test the code in different browsers for cross-browser compatibility.
